# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was build with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes and save them.

Once in your browser you can see:

1. Titlte 'NBA Player'
2. Instructions 'Please enter the height'
3. Input field with placeholder 'search'
4. and the results of the search 'No matches found'

You have to copy a number in the input field and the program
is going to search in a API which end point 
is ['https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/'] for NBA 
players who have a height bigger than the number you provided in 
the input field.

If you type 90 that is the tallest player you are going to see
'No matches found' in the screen, the same as if you keep the
input field empty.

if you type a number between 1 and 89 you are going to see
all players who have a greater height than the one you
provided in the input field.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

That launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the 
build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
